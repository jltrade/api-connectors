BitMEX API Connectors
=====================

A few simple connectors for connecting to the BitMEX API, which conforms to the
[Swagger](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-spec/blob/master/versions/1.2.md) spec.

Connectors in the `clients` and `servers` directories are autogenerated. Connectors in the `experimental` directory
are written by BitMEX employees to showcase various features.

See the `swagger.*` file in the root directory or src directory of each client to start.

WebSocket Adapters
------------------

The easiest way to get real-time data from BitMEX is via the
[BitMEX Delta Server](https://github.com/BitMEX/websocket-adapters/tree/master/server), a locally-runnable
HTTP server that subscribes to live data on your behalf. You can poll this local server as often as you want.

Other [WebSocket Adapters](https://github.com/BitMEX/websocket-adapters) are available in a separate repo.
