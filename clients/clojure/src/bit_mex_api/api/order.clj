If no order type is provided, BitMEX will assume 'Limit'.
Be very careful with 'Market' and 'Stop' orders as you may be filled at an unfavourable price.

You can submit bulk orders by POSTing an array of orders to `/api/v1/order/bulk`. Send a JSON payload
with the shape: `{\"orders\": [{...}, {...}]}`, with each inner object containing the same fields that would be
sent to this endpoint.

A note on API tools: if you want to keep track of order IDs yourself, set a unique clOrdID per order.
This clOrdID will come back as a property on the order and any related executions (including on the WebSocket),
and can be used to get or cancel the order. Max length is 36 characters.

To generate a clOrdID, consider setting a prefix, and incrementing a counter or generating a UUID.
Some UUIDs are longer than 36 characters, so use a url-safe base64 encoding. For example, the prefix `'bmex_mm_'`
and the UUID `'7fbd6545-bb0c-11e4-a273-6003088a7c04'` creates `'bmex_mm_f71lRbsMEeSic2ADCIp8BA'`.
