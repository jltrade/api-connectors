  # Get settlement history.

  # @param [Hash] opts the optional parameters
  # @option opts [String] :symbol Instrument symbol. Send a bare series (e.g. XBU) to get data for the nearest expiring contract in that series.  You can also send a timeframe, e.g. &#x60;XBU:monthly&#x60;. Timeframes are &#x60;daily&#x60;, &#x60;weekly&#x60;, &#x60;monthly&#x60;, &#x60;quarterly&#x60;, and &#x60;biquarterly&#x60;.
  # @option opts [String] :filter Generic table filter. Send JSON key/value pairs, such as &#x60;{\&quot;key\&quot;: \&quot;value\&quot;}&#x60;. You can key on individual fields, and do more advanced querying on timestamps. See the [Timestamp Docs](https://www.bitmex.com/app/restAPI#timestamp-filters) for more details.
  # @option opts [String] :columns Array of column names to fetch. If omitted, will return all columns.  Note that this method will always return item keys, even when not specified, so you may receive more columns that you expect.
  # @option opts [Float] :count Number of results to fetch.
  # @option opts [Float] :start Starting point for results.
  # @option opts [BOOLEAN] :reverse If true, will sort results newest first.
  # @option opts [Date] :start_time Starting date filter for results.
  # @option opts [Date] :end_time Ending date filter for results.
  # @return [Array<Settlement>]
